## Research Topic: New Sunscreen Product Development

### Executive Summary

The sunscreen market is experiencing significant growth due to increased consumer awareness of the importance of sun protection. However, there are several unmet needs and challenges in the market, including the lack of international regulation, the undefined status of nanoparticles, and environmental concerns.

To address these challenges, manufacturers are exploring innovative technologies and ingredients. Inorganic ingredients, such as those developed by Kobo, offer enhanced protection against HEV and IR radiation. Cyclodextrins improve sunscreen efficiency and safety, while nanosunscreens provide a more aesthetically pleasing experience.

Despite these advancements, the lack of a unified regulatory framework remains a barrier to innovation. The USFDA's stance on nanoparticles differs from other regulatory agencies, creating confusion for manufacturers and consumers.

To enhance consumer satisfaction, sunscreen brands are focusing on educating consumers about the importance of sunscreen, providing high-quality products, and making it easy to purchase their products. By addressing these key areas, brands can build stronger relationships with their customers.
