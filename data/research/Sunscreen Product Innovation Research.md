## Research Topic: New Product Innovation in Sunscreen

### Executive Summary

The sunscreen market is constantly evolving, driven by consumer demand for improved protection, convenience, and health-conscious ingredients. Key trends include the use of inorganic ingredients for enhanced protection, a focus on long-term effects, and the emergence of sunscreen sprays for ease of application. However, gaps remain in the market, such as the lack of international regulation and the undefined status of nanoparticles. Technological advancements, such as tinted sunscreens and sunscreen nanoparticles, are driving innovation and improving product efficacy. Future applications of these technologies hold promise for further advancements in sunscreen protection and consumer satisfaction.

### Core Functions

- Sunscreens protect the skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, including UVA and UVB rays.
- Different types of sunscreen products (e.g., lotions, sprays, sticks) offer varying levels of protection and convenience.
- Recent innovations include the use of nanoparticles and new carrier systems for enhanced UV absorption and distribution.

### Ideal Product/Service/Experience

- Ideal sunscreen products should provide broad-spectrum protection, high SPF, water resistance, and a pleasant user experience.
- Consumers seek sunscreens made with natural and organic ingredients that are safe for their health and the environment.
- Sunscreens should be formulated to maintain a healthy skin microbiome.

### Consumer Satisfaction

- Factors contributing to consumer satisfaction include broad-spectrum protection, high SPF, water resistance, hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic properties, and a pleasant texture, scent, and color.
- Sunscreen sprays and tinted sunscreens with added skincare benefits are gaining popularity.
- Improvements in inorganic UV filters have addressed concerns about white cast and ashy appearance on darker skin tones.

### Current Gaps

- Lack of international regulation creates confusion for manufacturers and consumers.
- The status of nanoparticles in sunscreens remains undefined by the USFDA, unlike other regulatory agencies.
- Unmet consumer needs include sunscreens that address specific skin concerns and provide long-lasting protection.

### Market Trends and Opportunities

- Inorganic ingredients are gaining popularity due to their enhanced protection against high-energy visible (HEV) and infrared (IR) radiation.
- Consumers are increasingly aware of the long-term effects of sun exposure, driving demand for sunscreens that prevent skin cancer and melanoma.
- Sunscreen sprays offer convenience and ease of application, leading to increased market share.

### Key Technology and Scientific Advancements

- Tinted sunscreens with added skincare benefits provide both protection and cosmetic enhancements.
- Sunscreen nanoparticles offer improved UV absorption and distribution, reducing the white cast associated with traditional sunscreens.
- Advancements in carrier systems enhance the delivery and efficacy of active ingredients.
