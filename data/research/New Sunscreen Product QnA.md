### Question: What are the different types of sunscreen products available in the market?

-  ### Requirements
- **Sunscreen products available in the market:**
 - Avobenzone has been in the market for a long time, but its application has been limited to the sunscreen industry due to its sun-blocking formulae.
 - USFDA has not defined nanoparticles as appropriate for sunscreen use like the other regulatory agencies.
 - Numerous studies have confirmed that there is underapplication of sunscreen and only 25-50% of the recommended is applied.
 - The lack of one international regulation criterion makes very confusing situations for the manufacturer as well as consumers.
 - Many sun protection products now include tints as well as ingredients for particular skin care needs.
