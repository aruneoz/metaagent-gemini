## Executive Summary: New Product Research Study on Sunscreen Products

### Key Findings:

- **Core Functions**: Sunscreens protect the skin from UV radiation by absorbing or reflecting it. Chemical sunscreens use ingredients like oxybenzone and avobenzone, while physical sunscreens use titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Hybrid sunscreens combine both types.


- **Ideal Product**: Consumers prefer sunscreens that are easy to apply, have a pleasant texture, and leave a non-greasy finish. They also seek sunscreens with added skincare benefits, such as moisturization or anti-aging properties.


- **Emerging Trends**: The sunscreen industry is seeing a rise in tinted sunscreens, herbal formulations, and the use of nanoparticles and liposomes to improve efficacy and stability.


- **Consumer Satisfaction**: Consumers are dissatisfied with the lack of international regulation criteria for sunscreens, which leads to confusion and inconsistency. They also express concerns about the effectiveness of sunscreens in protecting against the full spectrum of UV radiation.


- **Unmet Needs**: The sunscreen market lacks a single international regulation criterion, leading to confusion for manufacturers and consumers. Additionally, the USFDA has not defined nanoparticles as appropriate for sunscreen use, unlike other regulatory agencies.


- **Market Trends**: The global sunscreen market is driven by increasing awareness of sun protection, rising disposable incomes, and the development of new sunscreen technologies. However, confusing regulations and concerns about the effectiveness of sunscreens pose challenges to market growth.


- **Key Technology Advancements**: Cyclodextrins and nanoparticles are being used to improve the efficacy and safety of sunscreen products.


- **Future Directions**: Future research and development in sunscreen products will focus on studying particulate materials for sunscreen development, addressing sunscreen regulation inconsistencies, and clarifying the USFDA's stance on nanoparticles in sunscreens.
