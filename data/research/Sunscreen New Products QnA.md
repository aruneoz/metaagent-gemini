## Section: Core functions


### Question: What are the core functions of sunscreen products?

-  ### Requirements
- The FDA requires the labeling to include the expiration date for sunscreens where the manufacturer cannot provide stability data. (Source: 'gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:6')
- The USFDA defines broad spectrum sunscreens as those that give UVA protection proportional to UVB protection. (Source: 'gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:6')

### Question: How do different types of sunscreens (e.g., chemical, physical, or hybrid) vary in their core functions?

-  ### **Sunscreen Types and Functions**

- **Chemical sunscreens**: 
 - Absorb UV radiation and convert it into heat. 
 - Common ingredients include oxybenzone, avobenzone, and octinoxate. 
 - May be less effective than physical sunscreens in protecting against UVA rays. 
 - Source: [Document(page_content='Sunscreens using TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) tend to block shorter wavelengths from UVAII to UVB rather than longer wavelengths (visible and UVA range).', metadata={'id': '2e0856e3ccbc929cb50337b87f9e61f5', 'source': 'gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:9'})]


- **Physical sunscreens**: 
 - Reflect UV radiation away from the skin. 
 - Common ingredients include titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. 
 - Provide broad-spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB rays. 
 - May be more cosmetically elegant than chemical sunscreens. 
 - Source: [Document(page_content='Sunscreens using TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) tend to block shorter wavelengths from UVAII to UVB rather than longer wavelengths (visible and UVA range).', metadata={'id': '2e0856e3ccbc929cb50337b87f9e61f5', 'source': 'gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:9'})]


- **Hybrid sunscreens**: 
 - Combine both chemical and physical sunscreens. 
 - Offer the benefits of both types of sunscreens. 
 - May be a good option for people who want the best of both worlds. 
 - Source: [Document(page_content='Sunscreens using TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) tend to block shorter wavelengths from UVAII to UVB rather than longer wavelengths (visible and UVA range).', metadata={'id': '2e0856e3ccbc929cb50337b87f9e61f5', 'source': 'gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:9'})]
