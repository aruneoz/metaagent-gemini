### Question: What are the core functions of sunscreen?

-  - Sunscreens protect the skin from UV radiation, which can cause skin cancer and other skin damage. (Source: Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology 86 (2023) 104720 3)
- Sunscreens work by either absorbing or reflecting UV radiation. (Source: Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology 86 (2023) 104720 3)
- There are two main types of sunscreen: chemical sunscreens and physical sunscreens. (Source: Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology 86 (2023) 104720 3)
- Chemical sunscreens work by absorbing UV radiation, while physical sunscreens work by reflecting UV radiation. (Source: Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology 86 (2023) 104720 3)
- Some sunscreens also contain ingredients that help to soothe and moisturize the skin. (Source: All Aglow. Many sun protection products now include tints as well as ingredients for particular skin care needs.)
