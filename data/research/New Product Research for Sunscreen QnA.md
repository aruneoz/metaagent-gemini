### Question: What are the core functions of sunscreen?

-  - Sunscreens protect the skin from UV radiation. (Source: gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/1-s2.0-S1773224723005725-main.pdf:3)
- Sunscreens can be chemical or physical. (Source: gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/1-s2.0-S1773224723005725-main.pdf:3)
- Chemical sunscreens absorb UV radiation, while physical sunscreens reflect UV radiation. (Source: gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/1-s2.0-S1773224723005725-main.pdf:3)
- Sunscreens should be applied liberally and reapplied every two hours. (Source: gs://cpg_innovation/cpg_webpage/How to choose the best sunscreen, according to these dermatologists.html:)
- Sunscreens are an important part of a healthy skincare routine. (Source: gs://cpg_innovation/cpg_webpage/Innovations in Skin Protection, Part 2_ The Big Trends in Sunscreens - The Skin Cancer Foundation.html:)

### Question: What are the different types of sunscreen?

-  - Sunscreens are classified as either chemical or physical. Chemical sunscreens work by absorbing UV rays, while physical sunscreens work by reflecting UV rays. (Source: https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/sunscreen-tips/types-of-sunscreen)
- There are two main types of UV rays: UVA and UVB. UVA rays are longer and can penetrate the skin more deeply, while UVB rays are shorter and can cause sunburn. (Source: https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-prevention/uv-radiation)
- Broad-spectrum sunscreens protect against both UVA and UVB rays. (Source: https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/sunscreen-tips/types-of-sunscreen)
- The SPF (sun protection factor) of a sunscreen indicates how well it protects against UVB rays. The higher the SPF, the better the protection. (Source: https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/sunscreen-tips/spf)
- It is important to apply sunscreen liberally and often, especially after swimming, sweating, or towel drying. (Source: https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/sunscreen-tips/how-to-apply-sunscreen)
