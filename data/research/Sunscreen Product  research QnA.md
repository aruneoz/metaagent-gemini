## Section: Core functions


### Question: What are the core functions of sunscreen products?

-  ### Requirements
- The FDA requires the labeling to include the expiration date for sunscreens where the manufacturer cannot provide stability data. (Source: 'gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:6')
- The USFDA defines broad spectrum sunscreens as those that give UVA protection proportional to UVB protection. (Source: 'gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:6')

### Question: How do sunscreen products protect the skin from the sun's harmful rays?

-  ### Requirements
- Sunscreens protect the skin from the sun's harmful rays by absorbing or reflecting UV radiation. (Source: Document 1)
- Sunscreens can be chemical or physical. Chemical sunscreens work by absorbing UV radiation, while physical sunscreens work by reflecting UV radiation. (Source: Document 1)
- The efficacy of sunscreens is evaluated on human subjects because of their nature. (Source: Document 5)

### Question: What are the different types of sunscreen products available on the market?

-  ### Requirements
- **Sunscreen products available on the market:**
 - Avobenzone has been in the market for a long time, but its application has been limited to the sunscreen industry due to its sun-blocking formulae.
 - USFDA has not defined nanoparticles as appropriate for sunscreen use like the other regulatory agencies.
 - Numerous studies have confirmed that there is underapplication of sunscreen and only 25-50% of the recommended is applied.
 - The lack of one international regulation criterion makes very confusing situations for the manufacturer as well as consumers.
 - Many sun protection products now include tints as well as ingredients for particular skin care needs.
