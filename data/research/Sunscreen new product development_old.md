 # Research Topic: Sunscreen: Exploring New Product Opportunities

### Executive Summary: 

Sunscreen is a topical product used to protect the skin from damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Sunscreens work by either absorbing or reflecting UV rays, preventing them from penetrating the skin. 

Sunscreens are an essential part of a healthy skincare routine and can help to reduce the risk of skin cancer, premature aging, and other skin damage. 

The global sunscreen market is growing rapidly, driven by increasing awareness of the importance of sun protection and rising disposable incomes. In 2021, the global sunscreen market was valued at $18.9 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.5% over the next five years. 

There are a number of trends driving the growth of the sunscreen market, including:

- Increasing awareness of the importance of sun protection: Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of protecting their skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. This is due to a number of factors, including the rising incidence of skin cancer, the increasing availability of information about the dangers of UV exposure, and the growing popularity of outdoor activities.


- Rising disposable incomes: As disposable incomes rise, consumers are able to spend more money on skincare products, including sunscreen. 


- Growing demand for natural and organic sunscreens: Consumers are increasingly demanding natural and organic sunscreens, as they are perceived to be safer and more gentle on the skin.


- Increasing popularity of online shopping: The rise of online shopping has made it easier for consumers to purchase sunscreen and other skincare products.


- The growth of the athleisure trend: The athleisure trend has led to an increase in the demand for sunscreens that are sweatproof and water-resistant.


- The increasing popularity of tinted sunscreens: Tinted sunscreens are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer both sun protection and coverage.


- The growing demand for sunscreens for children: Parents are increasingly concerned about the effects of sun exposure on their children's skin, and they are looking for sunscreens that are safe and effective for children.


- The increasing demand for sunscreens for sensitive skin: Consumers with sensitive skin are looking for sunscreens that are gentle and non-irritating.


- The growing demand for sunscreens that are reef-safe: Consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact of sunscreens on coral reefs, and they are looking for sunscreens that are reef-safe.

### Consumer Satisfaction: 

- The lack of one international regulation criterion makes very confusing situations for the manufacturer as well as consumers. 
- Numerous studies have confirmed that there is underapplication of sunscreen and only 25-50% of the recommended amount is applied. 
- Sunscreens are evaluated on human subjects because of their nature. 

### Current Gaps in the Sunscreen Market: 

- The lack of one international regulation criterion makes very confusing situations for the manufacturer as well as consumers. 
- USFDA has not defined nanoparticles as appropriate for sunscreen use like the other regulatory agencies. 

### Market Trends and Opportunities: 

- Nanoparticles are not defined as appropriate for sunscreen use by the USFDA [5ab36adf01d890628d1b45c2e33979ff]. 
- Sunscreen has been proven effective in prevention of several diseases such as skin cancer and melanoma [5ab36adf01d890628d1b45c2e33979ff]. 
- Avobenzone has been in the market for a long time, but its application has been limited to the sunscreen industry due to its sun-blocking formulae [22f34a85aa0963a2a01841773371b1c5]. 

### Key Technology and Scientific Advancements in Sunscreen: 

- Use of  Cyclodextrins are polysaccharides used as inclusion complexes to increase sunscreen efficiency and safety [56]. 
- The combination of UVB and UVA filters has become commonplace over the last 30 years. 
- Due to their low cosmetic acceptability, their use had been relegated to a secondary role, i.e., to accompany other combinations of organic filters or for use.
