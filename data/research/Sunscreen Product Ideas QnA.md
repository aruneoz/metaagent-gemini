## Section: Core functions


### Question: What are the core functions of sunscreen products?

-  **Core functions of sunscreen products:**

- Protection from UV radiation: Sunscreens primarily protect the skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the sun. They work by absorbing or reflecting UV rays, preventing them from penetrating the skin and causing damage. (Source: Skin Cancer Foundation)


- Prevention of sunburn: Sunscreens help prevent sunburn, which is a common and painful skin condition caused by overexposure to UV radiation. Sunburn can lead to skin damage, inflammation, and an increased risk of skin cancer. (Source: American Academy of Dermatology)


- Reduction of skin cancer risk: Regular use of sunscreen has been shown to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer, including melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. Sunscreens protect the skin from UV radiation, which is the primary cause of skin cancer. (Source: National Cancer Institute)


- Photoaging prevention: Sunscreens help prevent photoaging, which is the premature aging of the skin caused by exposure to UV radiation. UV radiation can damage the skin's collagen and elastin fibers, leading to wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging skin. Sunscreens protect the skin from these harmful effects, helping to maintain a youthful appearance. (Source: Cleveland Clinic)


- Moisturizing and nourishing the skin: Many sunscreens also contain moisturizing ingredients that help keep the skin hydrated and nourished. This is important because UV radiation can dry out the skin, making it more susceptible to damage. Sunscreens with moisturizing ingredients can help to keep the skin healthy and looking its best.
