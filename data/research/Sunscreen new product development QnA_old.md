## Section: Core functions


### Question: What are the core functions of sunscreen?

-  - Sunscreens prevent diseases. (Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology)
- Sunscreens can have added skin benefits. (The Skin Cancer Foundation) 

### Question: What are the different types of sunscreen?

-  - The USFDA defines broad spectrum sunscreens as those that give UVA protection proportional to UVB protection (FDA-US, 2017).  [Source: IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:9] 
- In India, the concept of cosmetic is similar to that in the United States, although the list of UV filters is based on the EU model rather than the US model.  [Source: IntJPharmChemAnal-9-4-141-150.pdf:9]

### Question: How does sunscreen work?

-  - Sunscreens prevent damage caused by UV exposure through the use of a nano particle delivery vehicle. (Source: gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/1-s2.0-S1773224723005725-main.pdf:21)
- Sunscreens are evaluated on human subjects because of their nature. (Source: gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/1-s2.0-S1773224723005725-main.pdf:21)
- USFDA has not defined nanoparticles as appropriate for sunscreen use like the other regulatory agencies. (Source: gs://cpg_innovation/scientific_research/1-s2.0-S1773224723005725-main.pdf:21)
- Sunscreens cannot completely protect you from the sun so it's important to always reapply throughout the day, wear protective clothing (hats, sun-protective swimwear, clothing, etc.) and always seek shade.
