0,"I love the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch line. It prevents sunburn while still allowing my skin to get some color, it has a non-greasy feel, and it has just a very faint floral scent that is not obnoxiously ""beachy.""I have been using the SPF 30 formula for a few years and love it because it adds a subtle dewy radiance on my face that works well under makeup, spreads easily, and does not have a white cast.I upgraded to the SPF 45 this summer knowing I'd have access to a pool for a few weeks, and the pro to the SPF 45 formulation is that it does prevent sunburn, does seem to continue working even after getting wet, and also has the same faint floral scent on the SPF30 version. But the cons are that it has a subtle-but-noticable white cast and is thicker and requires more product to spread evenly everywhere. It still dries down/absorbs to be far less greasy than other sunscreens, but it is a little thicker feeling on the body than the SPF30 formula.I usually apply the sunscreen and give it at least 10 minutes to ""soak in"" before going into the sun, sitting/laying down, letting my hair down, etc. And in that time, the white cast does lessen, and the product does loose some of its initial lotiony oiliness... all in all, though, it feels like a noticeably heavier product than the SPF30.  Which feels great when I'm in a skimpy swimsuit under the hot sun intentionally trying to get a little protective color on my skin for the season, without damaging it, and also not wanting to reapply as frequently if I'm outside for the whole afternoon, but I'll be switching back to the SPF 30 for all other purposes.The SPF30 needs to be re-applied more frequently if you plan to be exposed to the sun for continuous time, but even though it offers less protection, I feel like the formulation is just right in terms of spreadability, absorption time, lack of white cast, and versatility.So 5 stars on SPF45 version in terms of it working as advertised, but 4 stars due to it not being quite as versatile as it's SPF 30 sibling. I feel like I also use much more of the SPF45 than the SPF30 to get the same amount of physical coverage due to it being more viscous.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

1,"This ultra sheer is easy to apply but does give a white cast to the skin, even after waiting 10 minutes for the skin to take it in before doing anything else. It seems to protect well enough, though, and that is important for me. It doesn't take much sun exposure for me to tan and, unfortunately, I now display the damage that causes. So, other than leaving that white cast to the skin (I am dark skinned, BTW), this is working out great for me, even through sweating, and I would recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

22,"It leaves a smell but it's super good for this price. There is no oily-ness left over after rubbing it in and leaves a dry touch as the name suggests. There is minimal whitecast and feels invisible after putting it on. Though it does dry down quickly so you'd have to smooth it out quickly too. Once it dries, you're left with whatever you have at the moment (if you have white streaks, you're stuck with that).

My skin is sensitive and tends to dehydrate easily, as well as redden easily in the sun or have small acne breakouts when a product clogs pores and although this sunscreen is really cheap (less than $10), I don't get any of that using it. I use it mostly when I run not so early in the morning or go to an outdoor activity, and despite sweating, it stays on the skin.

Even though there is a slight white cast on dark skin, it still isn‚Äôt as bad as other brands. It is somewhat greasy, but I have oily skin. It blends well and is easy to spread.My only con is that after 8-12 hours of wear (I work 10-12 hours), it SERIOUSLY burns my eyes. If I scratch or rub near my eye, it will burn enough to make me have to wash it off. Because of this, I wouldn‚Äôt put it on my baby.But I still love this sunscreen.

31,"I wanted to love this sunscreen. I loved that it did not have sulfates, parabens, etc. I loved that it had a lot of natural ingredients. When I used it I loved that it spread well, did not leave a white cast and absorbed well so I could apply under makeup without it feeling greasy or pilling.  I did not do a patch test, my mistake. I did not realize that Methyl Dihydroabietate is derived from pine resin. I discovered my allergy to pine resin years ago while cutting down a pine tree for Christmas. I experienced contact dermatitis. My face, neck and upper chest became very red and itchy after using this for a few days. No one else in the family had problems and really liked this sunsceen but I will probably not buy again. I will buy something that everyone can use.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

34,"This is hands down my favorite sunscreen for kids.First off, love that it's SPF 50 but doesn't leave an absolute mask of whiteness. There's still a cast, but it's tolerable.What really sets Pipette apart is how gentle and moisturizing it is. It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave that sticky or greasy feeling that some other sunscreens do. I feel like it's a dual moisturizer + SPF with the squalane.The fact that it's a mineral sunscreen is another major plus. At my child's age, I will not use chemical sunscreens on their face yet. It's safe and hypoallergenic. I see lots of derms on social media rave about it as being great for kids and I agree. We have gone through multiple bottles.All in all, Pipette Mineral Sunscreen has become a staple in our family. It's not just sun protection; it's skin care that I can feel good about. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing sunscreen for their kids. It's a total game-changer!","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

35,"I have pale, dry skin, and I burn easily. I wear sunscreen for preventing premature aging, so I wear this on my face, neck, and hands. I also have mild rosacea.Also, as much as I do prefer mineral sunscreens, some of the claims they make have been proven false or exaggerated. Science can't actually prove that chemical sunscreens harm coral reefs because they can't test on a large enough scale. And the claim that harmful chemicals are absorbed into the bloodstream is mostly a marketing tactic, not all sunscreen chemicals are harmful. Do your own research, and remember: the best sunscreen is the one that you will wear every day.That being said, here are my pros and cons for this sunscreen.The pros:- this is a mineral sunscreen: my face in particular can't handle chemical sunscreens- it's lightweight and easy to rub in- it doesn't burn my eyes unless I rub them and get the product in them, which is my own fault- it leaves a dewy finish. My skin is dry, so I prefer this to a matte finish- I get a tiny amount of white cast, but it goes away after it gets absorbed into the skin- it is very moisturizing, I stopped using my moisturizer in the morning when I started using this- it smells like sunscreen, but not really. And it goes away almost instantly- it's broad spectrum and SPF 50. We don't know the PPD value, but 20% zinc oxide is pretty high, and zinc oxide itself is a good sun-blocking ingredient.- the ingredients: squalene is super moisturizing, and glycerin is a good humectant. It's also fragrance-free- it's NOT water-resistant. This is a pro for me for 2 reasons. (1) some water-resistant sunscreens make my face break out and (2) I can't wash my face with a cleanser every day, so I need a sunscreen that comes off with just waterThe cons:- it feels weird on the skin before it absorbs. While squalene is very moisturizing, it has a texture and if you're sensitive then this can be a little uncomfortable for a few minutes while it absorbs.- it's also sticky while it's absorbing- if you put a full 2 fingers worth on at one time, it feels weird and heavy. I do 1 finger, let it absorb, then do another 1 fingerI work in an office, so I only apply this before I leave for work. If I'm out for the day, I re-apply every 2 hours. After the 4th or so application it does start to feel heavy, but at least I know my skin is moisturized and protected.All in all, I will be repurchasing this as long as they don't make it water-resistant. I can wear it every day, and reapply as needed with no issues.Update 5/9/2022I have repurchased this sunscreen twice now. I still love it and it's the only one I can use consistently. Another pro is that the squalane makes this a really good slip for my morning gua sha routine.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars

37,"It caused an allergic reaction.But first the pros: Pipette gets a gold star rating for being a clean product.  The texture is great and it goes on easily. Minimal white cast that fades really fast.  Sadly, I have a severe allergic reaction to something in this sunscreen. I have NEVER had an allergic reaction to anything.  Ever.  I do have sensitive skin so I‚Äôm really careful about products that I use.  I have rosacea. That could possibly be a factor.  I originally thought other products were to blame because how could this amazing sunscreen be the culprit??!  So sadly, I had 3 major flare ups. Each time, I am talking about burning and itching that makes you crazy, swelling, yelps. Mainly on my neck.  Benadryl would help.  A week of nothing but Cetaphil and aquaphor. The reaction to my face is less severe but my skin would feel like sandpaper. It would take an entire week to get better. My arms and hands had minor redness and itching.

42,"I've been using this sunscreen for about a year now. I am afrolatina and wear Fenty Beauty Pro Filter color 350, Loreal True Match liquid color W7, and Makeup Forever Ultra HD stick color Y445 for skin color reference.I have very sensitive skin. I cannot wear the Neutrogena Clear Face chemical sunscreen because it irritates the skin on my face, as do most chemical sunscreens.My dilemma was being able to find a mineral sunscreen that would not leave a white cast on my face. I don't like to wear makeup very often, so I do not have the option of covering up any potential white cast.Pipette has been absolutely wonderful! It is so gentle on my skin. My eyes do not burn, even when I sweat, and it doesn't give me a white cast.THINGS TO NOTE-I'll start by saying that I apply A LOT of sunscreen. I put a large nickel to quarter size amount on my fingers and rub it into my face and on my neck. So if this sunscreen was going to give a white cast, I would know.-The first ""trick"" I noticed to avoiding a white cast is that the sunscreen absorbs better when I have applied my serums and moisturizer first. In the MORNING use Timeless Vitamin C serum, followed by the Timeless Coenzyme Q10 serum, and I finish with the CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion. I don't use AM because it has sunscreen in it. After I apply those three products, I put on the Pipette sunscreen. On days where I've been in a rush and just put on sunscreen, I noticed that it took longer and required more rubbing to get the sunscreen to absorb. And even then, I felt like there was just the smallest hint of a white cast.-The second ""trick"" (or more of a notice) is that you have to give the sunscreen about 10 min to absorb. It will look like you will have a white cast right after you first apply, but after 10 min, it absorbs and clears up. So factor that time into your morning routine.-It goes great under makeup. I use liquid and stick foundations (with some powder over), and I have not noticed any change in application. I used to have very oily skin (particularly t-zone), but my skin is more normal now since I've been using tretinoin.-You may think that the sunscreen will make your face shiny or sticky upon first application, but it doesn't. Again, give it about 10 min to absorb.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome Mineral Sunscreen for Melanated Skin (No White Cast)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)
43,"I used to wear Artistry sunscreen but the price was exorbitant, $43 for 1.0fl. oz. I switched to Neutrogena, a chemical sunscreen and my skin had a reaction to it. It smelled chemical-like, and I couldn‚Äôt tell how heavy it was until I switched back to mineral sunscreen.If you‚Äôve had and are currently wearing sunscreens that have ingredients similar to the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer below, you‚Äôd see a huge difference in both the application and the touch of the Pipette sunscreen on your skin. This Pipette sunscreen feels very light on my skin, I haven‚Äôt had any reaction to it, and it doesn‚Äôt make my skin sweaty or sticky.This brand also advertises that the sunscreen can be washed down easily with water, and this is true as I haven‚Äôt had any troubles washing and cleaning my face at the end of the day, which was a big difference compared to the chemical sunscreen, where I always had this sticky feeling trying to clean it off my skin. As most sunscreens out there, you do need to reapply every 2-3 hours if you‚Äôre out about in the sun most of the day to keep it as effective as possible in protecting your skin.In terms of whitecast, as a few other users have mentioned in their reviews, I avoid it by applying a small amount twice. I don‚Äôt splash a whole chunk of sunscreen on my face at one time because ‚Äî this is a mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide, and I noticed that zinc oxide is one of the main ingredients that make your face go white if applied too much. So, I make sure to dab small dots around my skin and blend it well before applying another layer. You do this to your neck as well, you don‚Äôt want to leave your neck‚Äôs skin color unmatched to your face and be vulnerable to the sunlight. After a few minutes, your skin will look just fine.Of course, I do expect that my face may glow a bit whiter than other parts, but it just means people may know you‚Äôre wearing sunscreen to protect yourself. And this varies between different skin types too. I‚Äôm Asian so I have a warm-ish-yellow undertone, and this sunscreen suits me well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars

46,"I was starting to have red, irritated patches in varying spots (my forehead, cheeks, above my nose and nose) that I had chalked up to tretinoin irritation/sensitivity. I finished off a way less cosmetically elegant zinc sunscreen while working from home for a week or so and my skin recovered. Then, I switched to this fully for a couple days, and when the redness and irritation came back, I had my suspicions this was the culprit, and searched reviews - yep, I seem to be one of the unfortunate folks who are reacting to something in this sunscreen, even if my reaction is (thankfully) not as bad as many.I will say I totally loved how this felt on my skin, the minimal white cast, and was fine with the greasiness and the hydration it provided considering how drying most zinc only sunscreens are - the dewy look is in, anyway. My skin has broken out from many other sunscreens I've trialed, so I was so happy this NEVER caused breakouts for me.I had spot tested this on my jaw for a few days before putting it all over my face, and the jaw area never had reactions, so I'd recommend that while testing this out, you try somewhere you tend to breakout (jaw/chin for me), and then also a more sensitive area (maybe a cheek?) before putting it all over - even if you're not someone who rarely gets rashes or allergic reactions to products.This is a very affordable sunscreen, in addition to being the most cosmetically elegant mineral one I've ever used (including the now discontinued topix replenix sheer physical spray and cream), if it works for you! I'm so bummed that wasn't the case for me. I have no idea what the culprit irritating ingredient is, but if they ever reformulate, I'd absolutely try it again.","Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars

¬†Pipette SPF 50 is probably the most lotion-like mineral sunscreen I‚Äôve ever applied, so immediately it stood out to me. I loved it initially because application is a breeze. It‚Äôs so smooth and rubs in like a non-SPF lotion. But that initial impression quickly faded when it stayed sticky and shiny on my skin until I finally washed it off at the end of the night. Everything sticked to me when I wore this and it wasn‚Äôt a feeling I could get used to.The high percentage of squalane is probably to blame for the stickiness and shininess. Some people may enjoy the shine and perceive it as dewiness. My skin doesn‚Äôt take well to any high-oil products and generally they just sit on top of my skin, despite how light of an oil squalane is. If your skin loves and absorbs oil well, you may have a better experience with this product.As far as protection goes, 20% zinc oxide is very ideal for good UVA and UVB protection. Despite the high zinc oxide percentage, there‚Äôs virtually no white-cast (at least on my NC20 skin), and I‚Äôm not sure how Pipette succeeded in doing this but it‚Äôs impressive. They claim to not use non-nano zinc but from what I understand, there isn‚Äôt strong regulation on what is considered nano and non-nano zinc. I really don‚Äôt know what to think.As advertised, this sunscreen rinses off easily since it‚Äôs not water-resistant. This is obviously a pro for babies because you don‚Äôt want to have to scrub it aggressively off your baby at any point. But this also means it‚Äôs not a product that I‚Äôd want to use if I‚Äôm working out outdoors or swimming.","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars

48,"Quick summary, read for more detail: I would repurchase this product. For the price, you cannot beat the level of Zinc and SPF it has. Good ingredients and is hydrating. However, YES there is a white case that requires you to really take your time and blend it. Even after blending, there will likely be white patches or some white areas. With time, the whiteness does go down.For starters, I am a 4 on the Fitzpatrick scale. If you are like me, and all other people of color, you know that finding a mineral sunscreen that is affordable and does not leave us looking like ghosts - is difficult. I have searched so many mineral sunscreens and was excited to try this one. I am on Retin-A so I need a sunscreen.Everyone saying there is no white cast is not applying enough - seriously. But it's not all the way horrible. For the amount of Zinc, I think that it's manageable. It takes me around 3 minutes to work it in to my skin and blend it. After about 15 minutes it actually is pretty clear and fairly unnoticeable. But be prepared to blend, blend and blend. I look blue when I put it on at first, but I start to blend it all over and then gradually it kinda subsides - emphasis on kinda. People do notice that I look whiter (on the face) with it on. But I think overtime it kinda goes down.However, if you are peeling, the sunscreen latches itself onto dry patches leaving white blotches everywhere. So if you are peeling from any treatment or medication, good luck. I would also like to see EWG rating of this product and the UVA protection value which they currently do not show.Pros:- Generally, this sunscreen feels amazing on the skin. It leaves a nice glow and I like how hydrating it is.- No scent which is amazing.- After blending for a while and letting it sit, it does become fairly clear.- Good price for oz.Cons:- Emphasizes peeling skin by not blending in.- Requires a lot of time blending if you are a POC.- Subtle white cast","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars

50,"UPDATE:- Unfortunately there is a white cast under artificial light. If i'm under the sun it is fine so I would recommend this for beaches/hikes/runs etc. However, I would not wear this in the office as I become grey.ORIGINAL REVIEW:For reference I have dry and sensitive skin and was using a chemical sunscreen beforehand but am moving to use tret so I wanted a mineral sunscreen.[ THE PHOTO IS MY SKIN WITH THE SUNSCREEN ON, BARELY / NO WHITE CAST]I have tanish/lighter skin and other mineral moisturizers left a white cast on me (Cerave especially and Aveeno children's mineral sunscreen). The supergoop sunscreen also made me breakout which may be due to the silicone.In terms of this mineral sunscreen:1. It has a very very very faint/nonexistent white tint on my skin tone. But it is easily blendable if I keep rubbing it into my face.2. It is very moisturizing. Some people may not like this if they do not like stickier sunscreens, but I do not like the chalky texture of many mineral sunscreens and this sunscreen actually moisturizes my skin pretty well given that I have dry skin/will be using drying chemicals.3. I did not breakout from this sunscreen at all. My skin did not react in any type of way‚Äîthough it has to other sunscreens in the past.4. Getting this sunscreen off is not difficult. I use an oil cleanser than use the Cerave foaming cleanser at night and I am able to get this off easily.5. This suncreen does not pill when I use the Aveeno lotion (Green Daily Moisturizing Lotion), but it does pill if I use the Cerave Moisturizing cream so please be aware for anyone else using this. I am able to reapply it multiple times without pilling.Overall, I am a big fan of this sunscreen as I have no breakouts, it's easy to apply, doesn't pill with my Aveeno lotion, and is pretty moisturizing!","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars

51,We bought this product for our baby and for the family to have a non-toxic sunscreen. It works like any ordinary sunscreen and gets the job done. But I will warn you it‚Äôs much thicker and you may look like a ghost at first! It eventually absorbs and I love this brands reputation!

52,"The spf value and texture are actually really nice considering the amount of zinc oxide in the formula. I am a white person but I have warm olive undertones and this kind of showed up purple on my skin, but it usually went away after about an hour.My main gripe is that this really dried out and irritated my eye area, and this was the only product that changed in my skincare routine. I usually wear cerave lotion on the face followed by the BGS kid‚Äôs sunscreen spf 50. It works great. When I wear this stuff, it seriously dries out my eyelids. Within the first hour they look and feel tight and dry. I wore this stuff for two weeks and it made my eyelids peel and shed. It wasn‚Äôt necessarily painful, but it was extremely uncomfortable and jarring to have sizable rolls of skin coming off of my eyelids & eye area whenever I touched them. I also tried this product because my BGS uses organic UV filters so there is always going to be eye sting. This one stings about the same amount. I‚Äôm not reallly sure what I was expecting but this stuff really dries out my actual eyeballs and my contacts. This is a hard pass around the eyes and eye region, at least for me.On the rest of my face, though, this worked fine. It didn‚Äôt really aggravate or pacify my acne, which is fine, and it didn‚Äôt necessarily leave me feeling more or less dry in those areas, like my mouth, cheeks, and jaw.  Around my hairline, this kind of has trouble blending in, but that‚Äôs a product of mineral sunscreens period. My stubble also really struggled with this. I think the texture and consistency of this stuff is more suitable on the body, but I‚Äôd use it on my face if I was out of my daily stuff. The texture of it is really nice. I like to look lacquered, shiny, and glowy, and this product can certainly accomplish that.Overall, not sure why it doesn‚Äôt work out for my around my eyes but it‚Äôs pretty good for places that aren‚Äôt my eyes or under eyes.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars

The BoJ one stung like crazy and dried my eyes out so I couldn‚Äôt even finish half the bottle.Pipette, however, feels amazing on my skin.

55,"I'm very fair so it doesn't particularly matter to me, but this does leave somewhat of a pale violet cast that I could see being frustrating for those with deeper complexions. However, it has a beautiful finish, and makeup performs well on top of it after it has set down for a few minutes. I would recommend this for other pale people like me.","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

56,"I bought this sunscreen because it's free of many harmful ingredients in other sunscreens. It spreads well, but if you put on too much it leaves a white cast. For everyday use, if I use a smaller amount there is no white cast, and since it's SPF 50 using less is still quite protective. On the other hand, I applied it liberally for a day out skiing and wasn't sunburned at all by the end, so I'd say it works well!","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

57,"This is an excellent physical sun block. It is part of the Pipette baby product line, but adults can use it too.1. Very easy to spread. Among physical sunblocks, it is one of the easiest to spread. This is in contrast with Blue Lizard and Badger, which  are so thick and the difficulty to spread has become a deterrent to use. And the best sunscreen is the one that you feel like consistently using and actually use.2. It has a slight white cast. There‚Äôs no non-nano zinc oxide based sunscreen that absolutely doesn‚Äôt leave any white cast. Any claim contrary to that is nothing but a marketing ploy. Zinc oxide is white, unfortunately. With that said, this sunblock leaves the least amount of white cast I‚Äôve ever seen for a 100% physical sunscreen. Considering it contains 20% of zinc oxide, this is very impressive. I have olive skin tone, the white cast is only slightly noticeable. However, if you have brown or dark brown skin, the white cast will be more obvious.3. It is slightly greasy and leaves a shiny sheen on my normal skin, but not too much. Again, for 100% physical sunblock, greasiness is typical, as it needs an vehicle to carry the mineral. Some other products I tried are much worse. This one is pretty tolerable. But for people with oily to very oily skin, it probably doesn‚Äôt feel very comfortable.4. This sunscreen is not water resistant. There‚Äôs no water proof sunscreen. But some sunscreens are water resistant. They will be labeled as such on the package. You can see water resistant label for either 40 minutes or 80 minutes in US. This sunscreen is not water resistant. This may not be an issue for babies, for whom the Pipette products line is designed for. But for an adult, if you want to wear it for sport or any water activities or if you just sweat a lot, this will not fit the purpose. On the other hand, not being water resistant means it is easily cleaned off at the end of day (no need to use special cleansing oil). So it may be an advantage for daily use.","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars

58,"I'm an Indian gal, so I have dark skin- about a IV on the Fitzpatrick scale AND I have sensitive skin, which is the worst combo ever because chemical sunscreens irritate my skin while mineral sunscreens leave a white cast. This sunscreen is great for my skin though! And just so you know, I am not skimpy with it- I put on at least a quarter teaspoon- probably more- every application. It has no fragrance, which I love and some great ingredients. It does not irritate my skin at all, and doesn't burn my eyes (which is a must because I wear contacts) and it doesn't leave a white cast. The texture of the sunscreen isn't super chalky or gritty either. That being said, it does take a couple extra seconds to blend in and sink into the skin, but I personally don't find that a problem, because it makes me spend more time with applying the sunscreen which dermatologists say is essential to ensure you have good coverage- the more time you spend blending it in, the more protection you get. I really recommend a combination of both rubbing it into the skin and patting and pressing it into the skin...the warmth of your hands really helps it absorb quite quickly and nicely. Anyhow..my main issue with this sunscreen is that it is pretty greasy...which really annoys me. Like I don't even wear makeup because I don't like the feeling of something being on the face. And due to the greasiness and the heaviness of this sunscreen, it is pretty hard to forget that something is on my face...HOWEVER, I have found a solution to the problem. All I do is I dust my face with a little bit of powder after putting on the sunscreen. It sucks up the oil, and makes the sunscreen feel super light!","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars

59,"I have pretty oily skin already, so spreading this stuff on my face feels kind of gross. It also does separate a bit. It doesn't leave a white cast on me when I rub it in, but the greasy feel doesn't really go away. It works as spf, so I'm willing to use it for long days in the sun when sun protection is a priority, but I wouldn't use this as a daily sunscreen. I really appreciate that it's on the cleaner end for sunscreen, as I'm trying to get away from the more toxic chemical sunscreens. So I'll use this one, but keep looking as well.","Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars
