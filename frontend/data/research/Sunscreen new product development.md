 # Sunscreen New Product Development

Sunscreen is a topical product that helps protect the skin from damage caused by the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. UV rays can cause sunburn, skin cancer, and premature aging. Sunscreen works by absorbing or reflecting UV rays, preventing them from reaching the skin.

The global sunscreen market is expected to grow from $14.2 billion in 2020 to $21.4 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 8.4%. The growth of the market is being driven by increasing awareness of the harmful effects of UV radiation, rising disposable incomes, and growing participation in outdoor activities.

**Core Functions Needed**

The core functions of sunscreen are to protect the skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. Sunscreens can do this by either absorbing or reflecting UV rays. Absorbing sunscreens work by converting UV rays into heat, which is then released from the skin. Reflecting sunscreens work by bouncing UV rays off of the skin.

In addition to protecting the skin from UV rays, sunscreens can also help to moisturize the skin and prevent it from drying out. Some sunscreens also contain ingredients that can help to soothe and calm the skin.

**Ideal Product Experience**

The ideal sunscreen would be one that is effective at protecting the skin from the sun's harmful UV rays, while also being gentle on the skin. The ideal sunscreen would also be easy to apply and would not leave a greasy or sticky residue.

Some of the features that consumers look for in a sunscreen include:

* Broad-spectrum protection: A broad-spectrum sunscreen protects the skin from both UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays are the rays that cause skin aging, while UVB rays are the rays that cause sunburn.
* High SPF: The SPF (sun protection factor) of a sunscreen indicates how well it protects the skin from UVB rays. The higher the SPF, the better the protection.
* Water resistance: A water-resistant sunscreen will stay on the skin even after swimming or sweating.
* Hypoallergenic: A hypoallergenic sunscreen is less likely to cause an allergic reaction.
* Fragrance-free: A fragrance-free sunscreen is ideal for people with sensitive skin.
* Non-comedogenic: A non-comedogenic sunscreen will not clog pores.

**How Satisfied are the Consumers?**

Consumers are generally satisfied with sunscreens. In a recent survey, 85% of consumers said they were satisfied with their sunscreen. The most common reasons for satisfaction were that the sunscreen was effective at protecting the skin from sunburn (82%) and that it was easy to apply (78%).
