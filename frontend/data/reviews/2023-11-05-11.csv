0,"I love the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch line. It prevents sunburn while still allowing my skin to get some color, it has a non-greasy feel, and it has just a very faint floral scent that is not obnoxiously ""beachy.""I have been using the SPF 30 formula for a few years and love it because it adds a subtle dewy radiance on my face that works well under makeup, spreads easily, and does not have a white cast.I upgraded to the SPF 45 this summer knowing I'd have access to a pool for a few weeks, and the pro to the SPF 45 formulation is that it does prevent sunburn, does seem to continue working even after getting wet, and also has the same faint floral scent on the SPF30 version. But the cons are that it has a subtle-but-noticable white cast and is thicker and requires more product to spread evenly everywhere. It still dries down/absorbs to be far less greasy than other sunscreens, but it is a little thicker feeling on the body than the SPF30 formula.I usually apply the sunscreen and give it at least 10 minutes to ""soak in"" before going into the sun, sitting/laying down, letting my hair down, etc. And in that time, the white cast does lessen, and the product does loose some of its initial lotiony oiliness... all in all, though, it feels like a noticeably heavier product than the SPF30.  Which feels great when I'm in a skimpy swimsuit under the hot sun intentionally trying to get a little protective color on my skin for the season, without damaging it, and also not wanting to reapply as frequently if I'm outside for the whole afternoon, but I'll be switching back to the SPF 30 for all other purposes.The SPF30 needs to be re-applied more frequently if you plan to be exposed to the sun for continuous time, but even though it offers less protection, I feel like the formulation is just right in terms of spreadability, absorption time, lack of white cast, and versatility.So 5 stars on SPF45 version in terms of it working as advertised, but 4 stars due to it not being quite as versatile as it's SPF 30 sibling. I feel like I also use much more of the SPF45 than the SPF30 to get the same amount of physical coverage due to it being more viscous.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

1,"It leaves a smell but it's super good for this price. There is no oily-ness left over after rubbing it in and leaves a dry touch as the name suggests. There is minimal whitecast and feels invisible after putting it on. Though it does dry down quickly so you'd have to smooth it out quickly too. Once it dries, you're left with whatever you have at the moment (if you have white streaks, you're stuck with that). It also takes a while to wash off but I think it's worth it for the protection you're getting.","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

2,"I loved this sunscreen. My skin is sensitive and tends to dehydrate easily, as well as redden easily in the sun or have small acne breakouts when a product clogs pores and although this sunscreen is really cheap (less than $10), I don't get any of that using it. I use it mostly when I run not so early in the morning or go to an outdoor activity, and despite sweating, it stays on the skin. Also, it has a mild essence that fades within minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

10,"I hate most sunscreens, because they make me break out.  Most feel greasy going on, heavy while I'm wearing them, and they make me sweat.  Finally, here's a sunscreen I can wear everyday.  It's not greasy, not heavy, doesn't make me sweat and I don't break out.The only thing I worry about is some of the chemicals used.  However, the same company makes a 20% zinc oxide sunscreen that I plan to try soon.  That's a physical sunscreen, which physically blocks the sun's rays (like wearing a shirt) rather than a chemical sunscreen like this one, which absorbs the energy from the sun's rays.","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

30,"This is hands down my favorite sunscreen for kids.First off, love that it's SPF 50 but doesn't leave an absolute mask of whiteness. There's still a cast, but it's tolerable.What really sets Pipette apart is how gentle and moisturizing it is. It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave that sticky or greasy feeling that some other sunscreens do. I feel like it's a dual moisturizer + SPF with the squalane.The fact that it's a mineral sunscreen is another major plus. At my child's age, I will not use chemical sunscreens on their face yet. It's safe and hypoallergenic. I see lots of derms on social media rave about it as being great for kids and I agree. We have gone through multiple bottles.All in all, Pipette Mineral Sunscreen has become a staple in our family. It's not just sun protection; it's skin care that I can feel good about. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing sunscreen for their kids. It's a total game-changer!","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

33,"I have pale, dry skin, and I burn easily. I wear sunscreen for preventing premature aging, so I wear this on my face, neck, and hands. I also have mild rosacea.Also, as much as I do prefer mineral sunscreens, some of the claims they make have been proven false or exaggerated. Science can't actually prove that chemical sunscreens harm coral reefs because they can't test on a large enough scale. And the claim that harmful chemicals are absorbed into the bloodstream is mostly a marketing tactic, not all sunscreen chemicals are harmful. Do your own research, and remember: the best sunscreen is the one that you will wear every day.That being said, here are my pros and cons for this sunscreen.The pros:- this is a mineral sunscreen: my face in particular can't handle chemical sunscreens- it's lightweight and easy to rub in- it doesn't burn my eyes unless I rub them and get the product in them, which is my own fault- it leaves a dewy finish. My skin is dry, so I prefer this to a matte finish- I get a tiny amount of white cast, but it goes away after it gets absorbed into the skin- it is very moisturizing, I stopped using my moisturizer in the morning when I started using this- it smells like sunscreen, but not really. And it goes away almost instantly- it's broad spectrum and SPF 50. We don't know the PPD value, but 20% zinc oxide is pretty high, and zinc oxide itself is a good sun-blocking ingredient.- the ingredients: squalene is super moisturizing, and glycerin is a good humectant. It's also fragrance-free- it's NOT water-resistant. This is a pro for me for 2 reasons. (1) some water-resistant sunscreens make my face break out and (2) I can't wash my face with a cleanser every day, so I need a sunscreen that comes off with just waterThe cons:- it feels weird on the skin before it absorbs. While squalene is very moisturizing, it has a texture and if you're sensitive then this can be a little uncomfortable for a few minutes while it absorbs.- it's also sticky while it's absorbing- if you put a full 2 fingers worth on at one time, it feels weird and heavy. I do 1 finger, let it absorb, then do another 1 fingerI work in an office, so I only apply this before I leave for work. If I'm out for the day, I re-apply every 2 hours. After the 4th or so application it does start to feel heavy, but at least I know my skin is moisturized and protected.All in all, I will be repurchasing this as long as they don't make it water-resistant. I can wear it every day, and reapply as needed with no issues.Update 5/9/2022I have repurchased this sunscreen twice now. I still love it and it's the only one I can use consistently. Another pro is that the squalane makes this a really good slip for my morning gua sha routine.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars

37,"I've been using this sunscreen for about a year now. I am afrolatina and wear Fenty Beauty Pro Filter color 350, Loreal True Match liquid color W7, and Makeup Forever Ultra HD stick color Y445 for skin color reference.I have very sensitive skin. I cannot wear the Neutrogena Clear Face chemical sunscreen because it irritates the skin on my face, as do most chemical sunscreens.My dilemma was being able to find a mineral sunscreen that would not leave a white cast on my face. I don't like to wear makeup very often, so I do not have the option of covering up any potential white cast.Pipette has been absolutely wonderful! It is so gentle on my skin. My eyes do not burn, even when I sweat, and it doesn't give me a white cast.THINGS TO NOTE-I'll start by saying that I apply A LOT of sunscreen. I put a large nickel to quarter size amount on my fingers and rub it into my face and on my neck. So if this sunscreen was going to give a white cast, I would know.-The first ""trick"" I noticed to avoiding a white cast is that the sunscreen absorbs better when I have applied my serums and moisturizer first. In the MORNING use Timeless Vitamin C serum, followed by the Timeless Coenzyme Q10 serum, and I finish with the CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion. I don't use AM because it has sunscreen in it. After I apply those three products, I put on the Pipette sunscreen. On days where I've been in a rush and just put on sunscreen, I noticed that it took longer and required more rubbing to get the sunscreen to absorb. And even then, I felt like there was just the smallest hint of a white cast.-The second ""trick"" (or more of a notice) is that you have to give the sunscreen about 10 min to absorb. It will look like you will have a white cast right after you first apply, but after 10 min, it absorbs and clears up. So factor that time into your morning routine.-It goes great under makeup. I use liquid and stick foundations (with some powder over), and I have not noticed any change in application. I used to have very oily skin (particularly t-zone), but my skin is more normal now since I've been using tretinoin.-You may think that the sunscreen will make your face shiny or sticky upon first application, but it doesn't. Again, give it about 10 min to absorb.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars

40,"I used to wear Artistry sunscreen but the price was exorbitant, $43 for 1.0fl. oz. I switched to Neutrogena, a chemical sunscreen and my skin had a reaction to it. It smelled chemical-like, and I couldn’t tell how heavy it was until I switched back to mineral sunscreen.If you’ve had and are currently wearing sunscreens that have ingredients similar to the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer below, you’d see a huge difference in both the application and the touch of the Pipette sunscreen on your skin. This Pipette sunscreen feels very light on my skin, I haven’t had any reaction to it, and it doesn’t make my skin sweaty or sticky.This brand also advertises that the sunscreen can be washed down easily with water, and this is true as I haven’t had any troubles washing and cleaning my face at the end of the day, which was a big difference compared to the chemical sunscreen, where I always had this sticky feeling trying to clean it off my skin. As most sunscreens out there, you do need to reapply every 2-3 hours if you’re out about in the sun most of the day to keep it as effective as possible in protecting your skin.In terms of whitecast, as a few other users have mentioned in their reviews, I avoid it by applying a small amount twice. I don’t splash a whole chunk of sunscreen on my face at one time because — this is a mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide, and I noticed that zinc oxide is one of the main ingredients that make your face go white if applied too much. So, I make sure to dab small dots around my skin and blend it well before applying another layer. You do this to your neck as well, you don’t want to leave your neck’s skin color unmatched to your face and be vulnerable to the sunlight. After a few minutes, your skin will look just fine.Of course, I do expect that my face may glow a bit whiter than other parts, but it just means people may know you’re wearing sunscreen to protect yourself. And this varies between different skin types too. I’m Asian so I have a warm-ish-yellow undertone, and this sunscreen suits me well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars

44,"I was starting to have red, irritated patches in varying spots (my forehead, cheeks, above my nose and nose) that I had chalked up to tretinoin irritation/sensitivity. I finished off a way less cosmetically elegant zinc sunscreen while working from home for a week or so and my skin recovered. Then, I switched to this fully for a couple days, and when the redness and irritation came back, I had my suspicions this was the culprit, and searched reviews - yep, I seem to be one of the unfortunate folks who are reacting to something in this sunscreen, even if my reaction is (thankfully) not as bad as many.I will say I totally loved how this felt on my skin, the minimal white cast, and was fine with the greasiness and the hydration it provided considering how drying most zinc only sunscreens are - the dewy look is in, anyway. My skin has broken out from many other sunscreens I've trialed, so I was so happy this NEVER caused breakouts for me.I had spot tested this on my jaw for a few days before putting it all over my face, and the jaw area never had reactions, so I'd recommend that while testing this out, you try somewhere you tend to breakout (jaw/chin for me), and then also a more sensitive area (maybe a cheek?) before putting it all over - even if you're not someone who rarely gets rashes or allergic reactions to products.This is a very affordable sunscreen, in addition to being the most cosmetically elegant mineral one I've ever used (including the now discontinued topix replenix sheer physical spray and cream), if it works for you!

46,"The media could not be loaded. Pipette SPF 50 is probably the most lotion-like mineral sunscreen I’ve ever applied, so immediately it stood out to me. I loved it initially because application is a breeze. It’s so smooth and rubs in like a non-SPF lotion. But that initial impression quickly faded when it stayed sticky and shiny on my skin until I finally washed it off at the end of the night. Everything sticked to me when I wore this and it wasn’t a feeling I could get used to.The high percentage of squalane is probably to blame for the stickiness and shininess. Some people may enjoy the shine and perceive it as dewiness. My skin doesn’t take well to any high-oil products and generally they just sit on top of my skin, despite how light of an oil squalane is. If your skin loves and absorbs oil well, you may have a better experience with this product.As far as protection goes, 20% zinc oxide is very ideal for good UVA and UVB protection. Despite the high zinc oxide percentage, there’s virtually no white-cast (at least on my NC20 skin), and I’m not sure how Pipette succeeded in doing this but it’s impressive. They claim to not use non-nano zinc but from what I understand, there isn’t strong regulation on what is considered nano and non-nano zinc. I really don’t know what to think.As advertised, this sunscreen rinses off easily since it’s not water-resistant. This is obviously a pro for babies because you don’t want to have to scrub it aggressively off your baby at any point. But this also means it’s not a product that I’d want to use if I’m working out outdoors or swimming.","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars

47,"UPDATE:- Unfortunately there is a white cast under artificial light. If i'm under the sun it is fine so I would recommend this for beaches/hikes/runs etc. However, I would not wear this in the office as I become grey.ORIGINAL REVIEW:For reference I have dry and sensitive skin and was using a chemical sunscreen beforehand but am moving to use tret so I wanted a mineral sunscreen.[ THE PHOTO IS MY SKIN WITH THE SUNSCREEN ON, BARELY / NO WHITE CAST]I have tanish/lighter skin and other mineral moisturizers left a white cast on me (Cerave especially and Aveeno children's mineral sunscreen). The supergoop sunscreen also made me breakout which may be due to the silicone.In terms of this mineral sunscreen:1. It has a very very very faint/nonexistent white tint on my skin tone. But it is easily blendable if I keep rubbing it into my face.2. It is very moisturizing. Some people may not like this if they do not like stickier sunscreens, but I do not like the chalky texture of many mineral sunscreens and this sunscreen actually moisturizes my skin pretty well given that I have dry skin/will be using drying chemicals.3. I did not breakout from this sunscreen at all. My skin did not react in any type of way—though it has to other sunscreens in the past.4. Getting this sunscreen off is not difficult. I use an oil cleanser than use the Cerave foaming cleanser at night and I am able to get this off easily.5. This suncreen does not pill when I use the Aveeno lotion (Green Daily Moisturizing Lotion), but it does pill if I use the Cerave Moisturizing cream so please be aware for anyone else using this. I am able to reapply it multiple times without pilling.Overall, I am a big fan of this sunscreen as I have no breakouts, it's easy to apply, doesn't pill with my Aveeno lotion, and is pretty moisturizing!","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars

48,"I bought this sunscreen because it's free of many harmful ingredients in other sunscreens. It spreads well, but if you put on too much it leaves a white cast. For everyday use, if I use a smaller amount there is no white cast, and since it's SPF 50 using less is still quite protective. On the other hand, I applied it liberally for a day out skiing and wasn't sunburned at all by the end, so I'd say it works well!","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

49,"The spf value and texture are actually really nice considering the amount of zinc oxide in the formula. I am a white person but I have warm olive undertones and this kind of showed up purple on my skin, but it usually went away after about an hour.My main gripe is that this really dried out and irritated my eye area, and this was the only product that changed in my skincare routine. I usually wear cerave lotion on the face followed by the BGS kid’s sunscreen spf 50. It works great. When I wear this stuff, it seriously dries out my eyelids. Within the first hour they look and feel tight and dry. I wore this stuff for two weeks and it made my eyelids peel and shed. It wasn’t necessarily painful, but it was extremely uncomfortable and jarring to have sizable rolls of skin coming off of my eyelids & eye area whenever I touched them. I also tried this product because my BGS uses organic UV filters so there is always going to be eye sting. This one stings about the same amount. I’m not reallly sure what I was expecting but this stuff really dries out my actual eyeballs and my contacts. This is a hard pass around the eyes and eye region, at least for me.On the rest of my face, though, this worked fine. It didn’t really aggravate or pacify my acne, which is fine, and it didn’t necessarily leave me feeling more or less dry in those areas, like my mouth, cheeks, and jaw.  Around my hairline, this kind of has trouble blending in, but that’s a product of mineral sunscreens period. My stubble also really struggled with this. I think the texture and consistency of this stuff is more suitable on the body, but I’d use it on my face if I was out of my daily stuff. The texture of it is really nice. I like to look lacquered, shiny, and glowy, and this product can certainly accomplish that.Overall, not sure why it doesn’t work out for my around my eyes but it’s pretty good for places that aren’t my eyes or under eyes.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars

50,"Quick summary, read for more detail: I would repurchase this product. For the price, you cannot beat the level of Zinc and SPF it has. Good ingredients and is hydrating. However, YES there is a white case that requires you to really take your time and blend it. Even after blending, there will likely be white patches or some white areas. With time, the whiteness does go down.For starters, I am a 4 on the Fitzpatrick scale. If you are like me, and all other people of color, you know that finding a mineral sunscreen that is affordable and does not leave us looking like ghosts - is difficult. I have searched so many mineral sunscreens and was excited to try this one. I am on Retin-A so I need a sunscreen.Everyone saying there is no white cast is not applying enough - seriously. But it's not all the way horrible. For the amount of Zinc, I think that it's manageable. It takes me around 3 minutes to work it in to my skin and blend it. After about 15 minutes it actually is pretty clear and fairly unnoticeable. But be prepared to blend, blend and blend. I look blue when I put it on at first, but I start to blend it all over and then gradually it kinda subsides - emphasis on kinda. People do notice that I look whiter (on the face) with it on. But I think overtime it kinda goes down.However, if you are peeling, the sunscreen latches itself onto dry patches leaving white blotches everywhere. So if you are peeling from any treatment or medication, good luck. I would also like to see EWG rating of this product and the UVA protection value which they currently do not show.Pros:- Generally, this sunscreen feels amazing on the skin. It leaves a nice glow and I like how hydrating it is.- No scent which is amazing.- After blending for a while and letting it sit, it does become fairly clear.- Good price for oz.Cons:- Emphasizes peeling skin by not blending in.- Requires a lot of time blending if you are a POC.- Subtle white cast","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars

76,"Oh my gosh this sunscreen!  Where to start?  I got this sunscreen because of a recommendation from a dermatologist on YouTube I follow.  I was excited until I realized her recommendation must have been for an older version with 'Invisible Zinc'.The white face on this product is coocoo bananas INSANE!  I thought I might be able to pull it off by being a geisha or something but this product spreads very unevenly and starts to drag and ball up if you continue trying to rub it in after its dried.  It dries very quickly and very matte, so I guess that's a plus?  But the matte is more like liquid chalk that's dried on your face.I had applied this product before attempting to leave the house in my slightly darkened bedroom.  Ok, I looked a bit paler than usual but I thought maybe it could work in a 18th century lady sort of way?  I checked myself briefly in the bathroom mirror before leaving, thankfully, and decided staying in and washing my face would be more advantageous.  My skin not only looked very very white but the product was patchy with what looked like some areas of bare skin showing, uneven, and all over looked hideous making me look ill.  It was also treacherous to cover with tinted sunscreen.  This only spread the uneven white stuff around, but it didn't mix in with the tinted sunscreen, causing me to look as afflicted as ever with offending skin disease.The chalky, quickly drying product also settled into any and all facial creases making me not only look diseased but old and decrepit.Even though it has CeraVe's normally winning formula of ceramides and such this actual felt pretty drying.  My lips felt super dry after applying this.  Like I had walked through a snow storm and licked my lips the entire time and didn't drink any water dry, even though it has all that normally really good stuff from CeraVe in it.I also used it on my hands but I don't think I used anywhere near the appropriate amount of product to obtain the SPF because after putting it on my face I was worried how it would act elsewhere.  It wasn't too bad on my hands though it was still very white.  At least on my hands it kind of soaked in after it dried.  So even though my hands were really pale they didn't look abnormal.  It still highlighted every minute ridge on my hands though which meant I left my chalky chalk chalk fingerprints ON EVERYTHING!!I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying this product.  I love CeraVe but this sunscreen is either crazy or I don't know how to apply sunscreen.  Please do not buy it.I wish I could return it but it wouldn't be worth it to return through Amazon and there isn't a store I can return it without a receipt.  Oh well.Please don't buy!Edit- (Jan2020)Still working through the sunscreen and have some updates.  It is actually a good sunscreen at providing protection from the sun.  There is the huge caveat of the outrageous white cast however.If you try to rub the sunscreen in it will just get pasty and leave huge exposed areas and look really uneven.  However, I have found if I put it on and let it dry completely, like 15/20mins, I can then come in with a towel and rub off the outside cast layer.I look normal again and don't seem to get burnt so I guess it's working.Tl;dr- not as bad as I initially thought but definitely wouldn't buy again.  I'm looking forward to the new tinted sunscreen though","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2019","3.0 out of 5 stars
